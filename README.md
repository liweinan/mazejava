# Maze Java

A maze game written in java for fun.

## Usage

Create a 5x5 maze:

	   Maze maze = MazeFactory.createMaze(5, 5);

Print it:

	  maze.print();

Here is the result:

   	+---+---+---+---+---+
   	  >     |   |       |
   	+---+   +   +   +   +
   	|   |   |       |   |
   	+   +   +   +---+   +
   	|   |   |       |   |
   	+   +   +---+---+   +
   	|       |       |   |
   	+   +---+   +   +   +
   	|           |     V |
   	+---+---+---+---+   +


Now we try to generate a big one:

        Maze maze = MazeFactory.createMaze(25, 25);
        maze.print();

Result:

	+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
